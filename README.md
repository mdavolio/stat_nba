Year start 1988-89 (first year of 3rd all-nba team)

Analysis Plan?:
1) Predict which all nba team on (if any)?
2) Predict if voted as an all star (coach voted vs fan voted)?
3) Predict placement in award voting?
	How to we want to quantify this? 
	a) Logistic to if won or not
	b) Linear(?) for number of votes
	c) Linear(?) for share of votes

Data to Collect:
